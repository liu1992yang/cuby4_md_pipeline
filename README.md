# cuby4_md_pipeline
a pipeline to work with gaussian readable initial structures for cuby4-mopac interfaced BOMD and geometry optimization of snapshots from trajectories. Final output is Gaussian/gaussview readable format (`.com` or `.gjf` of your choice) with extracted energies at current computation level, ready for conformation sorting (see `geometry_clustering` repo)
